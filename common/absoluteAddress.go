// AbsoluteAddress structs are defined architecturally as a composite value generally not exceeding 54 bits,
// which allows the underlying hardware to determine the real-life location of a word in storage.
//
//	Given the following architectural specifications:
//		Small_Bank contains not more than 2^18 words
//		Large_Bank contains not more than 2^24 words
//		Very_Large_Bank is (usually) conceptual, being described as a set of consecutive large banks,
//			but in any case contains not more than 2^33 words.
//		Newer structures include the data expanse and the postern banks, which we do not implement,
//			at least for now.
//
// We need to implement an addressing scheme which accommodates these bank sizes.
// We expect that all virtual address banks will be contained in individual real-word allocated blocks of memory
// which are sized according to the logical bank size, where one logical word is right-justified and zero-filled in a
// space of 64 bits, which we represent as a uint64 (and thus, the bank is a slice of uint64 entities).
// Whenever the host program / operating system needs to carve out a new logical bank from machine memory,
// it will invoke a service instruction which does a malloc() to get a new block of real memory, and then the
// operating system is responsible for updating some existing bank descriptor table accordingly.
//
// Thus, our absolute address consists of the concatenation of a 21-bit segment identifier
// which allows us to describe a maximum of 2^21 (4194304) defined banks, with a offset value of 33 bits
// which describes a particular address within the bank identified by the segment identifier.
// This should be sufficient for our purposes, as we are focused on scale-out, not scale-up.
// To ensure that the non-significant bit fields are always zero, all code setting these values must use the Set* methods.
